**WINDOWS ONLY!**  
</br>
The project is new. A lot of things haven't been done yet.  
More attention was paid to the SFTP, the terminal has a low level of development.  
If you noticed abnormal behavior or other bug - please, create an issue.

### SFTP
- **SFTP transfers are not cancelable (yet)**  
- **If you uploading files they rewrite existing (is the same files are exists in dir)**  
- **SUPER FAST SFTP - UPLOADING/DOWNLOADING**  
- **Watching dirs/remove/delete and UPLADING/DOWNLOADING has a different connections, so by this way we have no browse lags**
